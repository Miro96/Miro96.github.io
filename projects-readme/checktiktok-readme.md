Frequently Asked Questions

How accurate is the automated verification?
Our system combines AI-powered search with source quality filtering and claim analysis. While we automate transcription, source gathering, and pattern matching, the verdicts are based on evidence from reputable sources. Results should be treated as preliminary fact-checking assistance, not as legal or medical advice. We recommend reading the cited sources for complete context.
What types of sources do you prioritize?
We prioritize verifiable, authoritative sources including: peer-reviewed academic journals, government databases and statistics, established news organizations with editorial standards, medical institutions and research centers, official organizational reports, and fact-checking organizations. We avoid anonymous blogs, unverified social media posts, and sources with poor track records.
Do you store or track the links I check?
We maintain minimal, temporary logs solely for service improvement and abuse prevention. We do not sell data or create user profiles. Your searches are not linked to your identity. See our Privacy Policy for complete details on data handling and retention periods.
What languages are supported?
CheckTiktok currently supports English, Russian, Spanish, French, Arabic, and Portuguese content. We're actively working on expanding language support to serve more communities worldwide.
Is CheckTiktok really free?
Yes, CheckTiktok is completely free to use with no hidden costs, paywalls, or required subscriptions. We're supported by ethical advertising and believe fact-checking tools should be accessible to everyone.
Real-World Verification Examples

Example #1: Local Government Ban Claims

Claim: 'City X has officially banned product Y.' We search municipal records, city council meeting minutes, local news archives, and official government websites. If we find a proposed ordinance but no enacted legislation, the verdict is 'Partly True' with explanation that it's under consideration but not yet law.

All source links are provided, allowing you to verify city council documents and news reports directly. This prevents the spread of premature or exaggerated claims.
Example #2: Medical and Health Claims

Claim: 'This natural remedy cures disease X in 24 hours.' Medical claims require evidence from peer-reviewed studies, clinical trials, or statements from recognized medical institutions. If we only find anecdotal testimonials, marketing materials, or unverified blogs, the verdict is 'False' with explanation that no credible medical evidence supports the claim.

We link to actual medical research databases, FDA statements, or reputable health organizations, helping prevent the spread of dangerous health misinformation.
Example #3: Statistical Claims

Claim: 'Crime has increased by 300% in region Z.' We check official crime statistics from law enforcement agencies, FBI databases, and statistical offices. If the actual increase is 30% or if the time period is misrepresented, we mark it 'False' or 'Partly True' and provide the accurate numbers with source links.
Current Limitations

⚠
Breaking news: Very recent events (within the last few hours) may not have sufficient verified sources available yet. Results improve as authoritative sources publish.
⚠
Unwritten claims: Local rumors, private conversations, or events without documented sources are difficult to verify without public records or news coverage.
⚠
Context matters: Always read the full linked sources. Headlines can be misleading, and complete context is crucial for understanding complex issues.
⚠
Opinion vs fact: The tool focuses on verifiable factual claims. Subjective opinions, satire, and artistic expression cannot be fact-checked in the same way.
⚠
Specialized topics: Highly technical or niche claims in obscure fields may have limited source availability. Mainstream topics generally have better coverage.
